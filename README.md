# LabView
This is a simple LabView project to control the GW Instek LCR-819 LCR Meter

An automated measuring system developed by us is presented for studying the dielectric spectra of ferroelectrics in the frequency range 10Hz-100kHz, and the amplitude of the measuring signal 40mV-1.2V. It is based on the GW Instek LCR-819 LCR Meter and the Measurement Computing USB-TEMP-AI temperature meter. The temperature measurement accuracy is 0.001K. The software developed by us, created in the LabVIEW graphical environment, makes it possible to carry out measurements in an automatic mode, present the results obtained in the form of graphs (Cole-Cole plot and frequency dependency of ε’ and ε”) and save the data as a file.
